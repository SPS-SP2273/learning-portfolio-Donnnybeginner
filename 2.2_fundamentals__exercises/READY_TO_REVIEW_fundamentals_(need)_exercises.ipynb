    "1. A function in Python is a sequence of code that carries out a specific action. For example, the print function prints out something as an output. They usually have parenthesis after them where we can enter arguments for the function.\n",
    "1. A variable is a sort of container for data in Python.\n",
    "1. = is used to assign a value to a variable while == is used to check if two items are equal to one another\n",
    "1. The if operator is used to make a decision. If the condition after the 'if' operator is True, then the indented code afterward would be executed. Otherwise, the code indented after the 'else' statement would be executed.\n",
    "1. Indentation is important and indented code may not be executed if the lines before do not have the appropriate code.\n",
    "1. Extra functionality can be transfered into python using the 'import' keyword. An alias can be assigned to the imported package. For example, the following will import the package numpy with np as the alias:  `import numpy as np`\n",
    "1. There are different types of brackets in python. () is used either to enter arguments into a function or for mathematical operations. [] is used for a list data type to enter an array of data. {} is used for a dictionary which stores key-value pairs."
